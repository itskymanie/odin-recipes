        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An Omelette tailored for its convenience. One of the first things I learned how to make as a youngin.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs or a cup of egg whites (if you et those carton eggs)</li>
            <li>1  diced roma tomato</li>
            <li>1/4 diced onion</li>
            <li>6 to 8 stems of chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 diced bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of italian seasoning</li>
            <li>a fistful of your choice of grated cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomato, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and italian seasoning over omelet.</li>
            <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to flip eggs. I, personally like mine a little brown. "That what she said."</li>
            <li>After desired brown is achieved, fold in half and add any stuffing you'd like a quesadilla.</li>
        </ol>
