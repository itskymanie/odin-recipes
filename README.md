# odin-recipes
In this project, I am creating Odin Recipes, a recipe website. I will be completing the project in multiple iterations, gradually adding new features and content.

In the initial iteration, I will set up the basic structure of the website by creating an index.html file with a heading "Odin Recipes".

Next, I will create recipe pages in a "recipes" directory, each containing an h1 heading with the recipe name. I will also add links to these recipe pages on the index.html file.

In the following iteration, I will enhance the recipe pages by including an image of the finished dish, a description of the recipe, a list of ingredients, and a list of steps to prepare the dish.

Finally, I will add two more recipes with the same page structure and include links to them on the index page, organized in an unordered list.

Through this project, I will demonstrate skills in HTML structuring, creating multiple pages, adding images, and linking pages together to create a functional recipe website.
